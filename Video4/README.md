make sure you have jq 1.6 installed in your linux

You have input file "file.json"
create bash script name "script.sh" and parse the json file
and go over all the Gender = "M" records only
for each person, take his id value and grade 
if the grade > 55 only then from the fileinfo, take the file name
   and parse this file, grab the number value

 so you have id,grade (from json) ,number (from the person text file)
 put them on result.csv file for example:


id,number,grade
11,555,90
44,999,100
